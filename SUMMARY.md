# Allervie Dashboard Google Ads API Integration

## Integration Complete

The Allervie Analytics Dashboard has been successfully enhanced with Google Ads API integration. Here's a summary of what has been implemented:

### Core Features Added

1. **Google Ads API Client**
   - Created a fully functional Google Ads API client (`google_ads_client.py`) that:
     - Reads credentials from environment variables
     - Creates the necessary YAML config files automatically
     - Connects to the Google Ads API to fetch real data
     - Provides a graceful fallback to mock data when needed

2. **Dashboard Integration**
   - The existing dashboard now automatically uses real Google Ads data when available
   - Shows a connection status indicator at the bottom of the dashboard
   - Provides clear feedback when using mock vs. real data

3. **Deployment Configuration**
   - Updated `app.yaml` for seamless deployment to DigitalOcean App Platform
   - Configured environment variables for Google Ads API credentials
   - Set up the correct build and run commands for deployment

4. **Testing and Validation**
   - Added a credential testing script (`test_credentials.py`) to validate Google Ads API setup
   - Implemented robust error handling to ensure the dashboard always works

### Deployment-Ready Features

- **Zero-Dependency Dashboard UI**: The core dashboard still uses only Python standard library
- **Google Ads API Integration**: Now added as a clean extension with proper dependency management
- **Simple Deployment**: One-command deployment to DigitalOcean App Platform
